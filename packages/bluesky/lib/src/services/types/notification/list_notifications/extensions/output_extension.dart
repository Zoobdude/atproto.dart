  ///   to that reason.
  /// - The `isRead` field in each group is determined by the most recent
  ///   notification in that group.
  /// - The `labels` field aggregates all labels from notifications in the same
  ///   group.
  /// - Returns a [GroupedNotifications] object containing the grouped
  ///   notifications.
